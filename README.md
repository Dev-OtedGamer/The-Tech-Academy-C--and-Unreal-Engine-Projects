# The Tech Academy C++ and Unreal Engine Projects
 This Repository is for all my submissions for C++ and Unreal for The Tech Academy
# Submissions
welcome to my GitHub! Here are some of my submissions for C++:

## submission 1: üì¶[Class Challenge Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-C--and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/blob/main/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment.cpp)
**Description:** This C++ project showcases core Object-Oriented Programming principles, specifically inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
‚úÖ Key Features:
Abstract Base Class:
Shape defines a pure virtual function getArea(), making it an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly.

Derived Classes:
Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle inherit from Shape and each provide their own implementation of getArea().

Encapsulation & Constructors:
Each class uses constructors to initialize specific attributes like color, dimensions, or radius.

Polymorphism:
The overridden getArea() method demonstrates polymorphic behavior across different shape types.

Output:
Displays each shape‚Äôs color and calculated area.

This assignment demonstrates how polymorphism and inheritance allow for reusable, scalable, and organized code when working with related object types.



## submission 2: üì¶[Oop Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-C--and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/blob/main/OopSubmissionAssignment/OopSubmissionAssignment/OopSubmissionAssignment.cpp)
**Description:** This project is a simple C++ program demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

**Project Overviewüê∂:**
Class: Dog
Properties (State): breed, color, height, weight
Methods (Behavior): shake(), sit(), laydown(), displayInfo()

Features:
Uses a constructor to initialize object state
Simulates real-world behavior through method calls
Demonstrates how an object can inherit and use class properties and methods

üß† What I Practiced:
Designing and using custom classes
Creating object instances
Encapsulating data and behavior in a real-world model
This project was completed as part of an OOP learning assignment, where I was shown a class structure and asked to recreate it in code with all its attributes and behaviors.
