# The Tech Academy C++ and Unreal Engine Projects
 This Repository is for all my submissions for C++ and Unreal for The Tech Academy
# Submissions
welcome to my GitHub! Here are some of my submissions for C++:

## submission 1: üì¶[Class Challenge Submission](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-C--and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/blob/main/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment/ClassChallengeSubmissionAssignment.cpp)
**Description:** On this submission I was asked to do some specific things :
Defines a base abstract class Shape with a pure virtual method getArea()
Implements three derived classes: Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle
Uses constructors and overridden methods to calculate and display the area and color of each shape
Demonstrates polymorphism via virtual functions

## submission 1: üì¶[Oop Submission Assignment](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/The-Tech-Academy-C--and-Unreal-Engine-Projects/blob/main/OopSubmissionAssignment/OopSubmissionAssignment/OopSubmissionAssignment.cpp)
**Description:** This project is a simple C++ program demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

 ## Project Overviewüê∂:
Class: Dog
Properties (State): breed, color, height, weight
Methods (Behavior): shake(), sit(), laydown(), displayInfo()

Features:
Uses a constructor to initialize object state
Simulates real-world behavior through method calls
Demonstrates how an object can inherit and use class properties and methods

üß† What I Practiced:
Designing and using custom classes
Creating object instances
Encapsulating data and behavior in a real-world model
This project was completed as part of an OOP learning assignment, where I was shown a class structure and asked to recreate it in code with all its attributes and behaviors.
